# ‚ö° Washington State EV Forecasting & Charging Infrastructure Planning (2025‚Äì2028)

This project delivers a data-driven strategy to forecast **electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends** and predict the **charging infrastructure needed** across Washington State through 2028. Using advanced **time series models** (Prophet, SARIMA, ARIMA) and **machine learning**, it provides actionable insights to help planners and policymakers address EV infrastructure deficits and plan equitable charger deployment.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Forecast monthly EV registrations from 2010‚Äì2028 at **state and county levels**
- Integrate **average EV sale price** as an external regressor to improve forecast realism
- Identify **infrastructure gaps** using **DOE/NREL benchmarks**
- Predict **annual station needs** by county (2025‚Äì2028)
- Allocate stations at the **ZIP-code level** based on demand/supply ratios
- Provide insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**

## üîÅ Process Implemented

1. **Data Collection**
   - EV registration data from Washington Open Data Portal (2010‚Äì2024)
   - Charging station data from OpenChargeMap

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, feature selection, time indexing, and handling outliers
   - County and ZIP-level aggregation for EV trends and infrastructure

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend visualization, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing

4. **Forecast Modeling**
   - ARIMA/SARIMA for baseline trend and seasonality modeling
   - Prophet for flexible forecasting, with and without external regressors
   - Fine-tuning via hyperparameter grid search and walk-forward validation

5. **County-Level Forecasting**
   - Individual models trained for top 10 counties using historical patterns and sale price influence

6. **Charging Infrastructure Gap Analysis**
   - EV-to-station ratios and comparison with DOE/NREL policy thresholds

7. **Machine Learning for Station Prediction**
   - Linear regression model trained on historical EV/station data
   - Station forecasts generated for 2025‚Äì2028 per county

8. **ZIP-Level Prioritization**
   - Normalized score based on EV demand vs. current supply
   - Proportional station allocation to underserved ZIPs

9. **Dashboard & Output Generation**
   - Interactive Power BI dashboard + downloadable CSV reports
   - Visuals, summaries, and maps per county and statewide
